Must:
  Add a means of displaying all premier league fixtures, paginated by gameweek and sorted by kickoff time and then alphabetically by home team name.

  Add a means of clearing predictions
  Add a means of using inputted scores to generate a predicted table (points, GF, GA, GD)
  Add hide/show button





Should:
  Add a means of obtaining current fixture lists & results for any given PL season
    Add a means of choosing whether to make predictions from current (real) results or clear the real results and make predictions from the start of the season
      Possibly allow overriding of individual fixture results?
  Add an application icon



Could:
  Add a Content Security Policy (CSP). This is unnecessary since only Nile will be using this app but might be good learning.
  Add tests - would be good practice.
